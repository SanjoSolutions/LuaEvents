# Lua Events

This work is devoted to God.

A library for working with events. This can help other add-on creators to save some work.

All functions can only be used inside coroutines.
You can check out the [Coroutine](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/coroutine) library for coroutine helpers.

With the provided functions, sequential code can be written for processes which require data that is provided via events.

**Functions included:**

* **Events.waitForOneOfEvents**: a function to wait for one of multiple events, with an optional timeout.
* **Events.waitForEventCondition**: a function to wait for an event of a specific type and a condition met. A timeout can be optionally passed.
* **Events.waitForEvent**: a function to wait for an event. A timeout can be optionally passed.
